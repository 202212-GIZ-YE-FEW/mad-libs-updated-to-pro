A Day At The Zoo!
Today I went to the zoo. I saw an [a] [n] jumping up and down in its tree.
He [v] ,[a]
through the large tunnel that led to its [a]
 [n]. I got some peanuts and passed
them through the cage to a gigantic gray [n]
towering above my head. Feeding that animal made
me hungry. I went to get a [a] scoop
of ice cream. It filled my stomach. Afterwards I had to [v] [a] to catch our bus.
When I got home I [v] my
mom for a [adj] day at the zoo.
